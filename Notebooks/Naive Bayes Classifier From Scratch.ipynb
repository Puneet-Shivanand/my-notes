    "2. Second, we assume have that the value of the features (e.g. the height of women, the weight of women) are normally (gaussian) distributed. This means that p(height∣female)p(height∣female) is calculated by inputing the required parameters into the probability density function of the normal distribution:\n",

    "* marginal probabilitymarginal probability is probably one of the most confusing parts of bayesian approaches. In toy examples (including ours) it is completely possible to calculate the marginal probability. However, in many real-world cases, it is either extremely difficult or impossible to find the value of the marginal probability (explaining why is beyond the scope of this tutorial). This is not as much of a problem for our classifier as you might think. Why? Because we don't care what the true posterior value is, we only care which class has a the highest posterior value. And because the marginal probability is the same for all classes 1) we can ignore the denominator, 2) calculate only the posterior's numerator for each class, and 3) pick the largest numerator. That is, we can ignore the posterior's denominator and make a prediction solely on the relative values of the posterior's numerator.\n"
